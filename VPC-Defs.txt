A gateway is simply a device that joins together two different networks. In the most common 
scenario, an internal network with the internet. A router is an example of a gateway device.

A router is a device that does routing, deciding where packets are sent to based on its IP 
 address.

A firewall is a filter that examines packets against a set of defined rules in order to decide
 whether to allow the packets through.

In many devices, the functionality of both a gateway and a firewall is present. Of course,
 there are dedicated versions of each for use in large enterprise networks.
 
 The default firewall in most of the Linux distributions is IPTables.

IPTables is used to manage packet filtering, DNAT(Destination Network Address Translation), 
SNAT(Source Network Address Translation) rules. IPTables comes with all Linux distributions.
